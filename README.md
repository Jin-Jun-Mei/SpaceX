# Rocket First Stage Landing Prediction

**Overview**

This repository contains my capstone project for IBM Data Science course, where the primary objective is to predict the successful landing of SpaceX's Falcon 9 rocket's first stage. This project encompasses various stages of data science workflow including data collection, data wrangling, exploratory data analysis, data visualization, model development, and model evaluation.


**Project Structure**

  Data Collection: Gathering data from multiple sources to ensure a comprehensive analysis.
  
  Data Wrangling: Improving the quality of the collected data by cleaning and structuring it effectively.
  
  Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Utilizing SQL and other analytical techniques to explore and understand the dataset.
  
  Data Visualization: Applying statistical analysis and visualization tools to uncover relationships between variables.
  
  Model Development: Creating machine learning models using techniques like support vector machines, decision tree classifiers, and k-nearest neighbors.
  
  Model Evaluation: Assessing the performance of the models to determine their effectiveness in predictive analysis.



**Final Deliverable**

The culmination of this project is a comprehensive presentation that encapsulates all the analyses, insights, and findings derived from the data.
